Description: Provides a tidy and user-friendly interface to supervised 
    machine learning methods. The package integrates with the tidyverse 
    ecosystem and offers functions for fitting, evaluating, visualizing, 
    and interpreting machine learning models. It supports regression and 
    classification tasks with a consistent API across different learning 
    algorithms, including linear models, decision trees, random forests, 
    boosting, support vector machines, and neural networks. The package 
    includes tools for model tuning, cross-validation, feature selection, 
    model diagnostics, and advanced visualizations of model performance.
